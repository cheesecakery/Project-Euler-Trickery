Nothing too serious. Playing around with Project Euler problems as they are a fun blend of thinking about programming efficiency and exploring fun mathematical problems. 
Attempted questions in Haskell as I liked thinking about solving problems in this more recursive way, or through taking advantage of Haskell's emphasis on higher order functions. 
Lots of fun!
